# ASL-machine-learning-project
A machine learning project aimed at recognizing finger spelling and displaying the text on screen.
This can be very helpful for the deaf and dumb people in communicating with others as knowing sign language is not something that is common to all, moreover, this can be extended to creating automatic editors, where the person can easily write by just their hand gestures.
It is made using python and ML models like CNN.
